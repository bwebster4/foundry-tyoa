# The Years of Adventure for Foundry VTT (Official)
Everything you need to play The Years of Adventure in Foundry VTT. This was forked from v1.0.0 of the WWN project developed by SobranDM (which was itself forked from v1.1.2 of the Old School Essentials project developed by U~man). U~man (and Sobran after him, despite protestations otherwise) built a beautiful system for their respective games. I've hacked that to work for my own system. All praise should be directed toward them. Any bugs or mistakes are undoubtedly my own.
