The Locomancer must be touching any objects they are attempting to teleport, and any living targets of a teleportation must be willing.

Unskilled casters risk the magic fizzling out at best, and losing themselves in the twisting nethers between dimensions at worst.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some Locomancers may learn the techniques to contact, interact with, and even travel to other dimensions. Dimensions may in fact be different universes, but they may also simply be other planets, or in a more fantastical setting the realms created by other gods or other planes of existence. Generally, there will be a small number of dimensions commonly known to the locomancers of the player character&rsquo;s world, with standard types of creatures in those realms contacted frequently. In fact, the governments of other dimensions may even have limited contact with the government&rsquo;s of the PC&rsquo;s realm, holding treaties related to summoning their citizens. Ultimately, the existence and appearance of these dimensions is determined by the GM.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of the type of creature in these alternate dimensions, any being summoned from another dimension is visibly marked by their otherworldliness and can always be understood to be from another dimension by anyone, even without magical experience. These creatures are commonly referred to as demons. This is not to say that any demon is inherently evil. Demons may simply be natural creatures exercising base instincts, or regular people (human or otherwise) forced to do the bidding of their summoner. Compared to Wyrds who have more in common with forces of nature than sentient creatures, demons are always sentient beings with their own wants and needs. Whether those desires are understandable to the player characters, however, is up to interpretation.</p>","ownedLevel":-1,"skillDice":"2d6"},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"tyoa","systemVersion":"0.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674262882028,"modifiedTime":1674262935832,"lastModifiedBy":"hgzxVNINjMdZTO5r"},"_id":"2H9dDsMeJD8NHwle","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"hgzxVNINjMdZTO5r":3}}

This type of magic is most often used to see into the future. However, chronomancy may only be used to see into the caster&rsquo;s own future, not a general future. When gazing into the endless possibilities of the future, a chronomancer is able to determine which scenarios are most likely to happen, but they cannot see possibilities beyond the scope of their own viewpoint.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some advanced techniques also allow visions into the past. However, visions into the past are unreliable, muddied by the memories of the chronomancer. To ground visions into the past, most techniques require grounding the vision on a physical, non-living object. The memory of non-living objects is always clear, and a good chronomancer may take advantage of this to see into the past.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When asking questions of the future or the past, a chronomancer is only able to gather a limited amount of information. They may ask a single question, which must be answerable either through their own potential future, or the past of some grounding object. For example, a chronomancer could not ask what will happen the next day in a city on the other side of the world, if there is no way they could be in that city in such a short amount of time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The answer to the question is usually not a simple response. Often, the chronomancer is instead met with a vision of some event surrounding their answer. In many cases, they may actually be presented multiple visions, and have an estimation of the likelihood of each of them. For example, a chronomancer attached to an army trying to defeat an enemy may ask the question, &ldquo;How will the enemy attack us?&rdquo; They may then be met with a few visions, one showing the enemy leading a frontal assault, another where they are drawn into an ambush, and a third where the enemy sets up to defend a chokepoint, inviting the chronomancer and allies to remove them. The chronomancer would also know that of these three scenarios, the ambush is most likely.</p>","ownedLevel":-1,"skillDice":"2d6"},"effects":[],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"tyoa","systemVersion":"0.1.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674262828888,"modifiedTime":1674262935827,"lastModifiedBy":"hgzxVNINjMdZTO5r"},"_id":"o4CCBlQB1c4pVya1","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"hgzxVNINjMdZTO5r":3}}
